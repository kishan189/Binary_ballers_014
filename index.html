        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our interactive platform where you can explore the design and functionality of different
            operating systems—right in your browser! This project is a web-based educational tool that simulates the
            unique user experiences and interfaces of popular operating systems, allowing users to compare and contrast
            their designs interactively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to bring the look and feel of Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu directly to your browser, giving you
            insights into the design choices and user experiences of each OS.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Our platform covers the following operating systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Dive into the clean and structured interface of Windows, known for its
                user-friendly navigation and productivity features.</li>
            <li><strong>macOS:</strong> Experience the sleek and polished design of macOS, celebrated for its seamless
                user experience and aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> Discover the minimalist and open-source design of Ubuntu, recognized for its
                flexibility and customization options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through this project, we aim to replicate the core elements of these operating systems using modern web
            technologies like HTML and CSS. Whether you’re here to learn, compare, or simply explore, our
            platform provides an educational journey into the world of OS design.
