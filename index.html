                Welcome to our interactive platform where you can explore the design and functionality of different
                operating systems—right in your browser! This project is a web-based educational tool that simulates the
                unique user experiences and interfaces of popular operating systems.

                Our goal is to bring the look and feel of Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu directly to your browser, giving
                you
                insights into the design choices and user experiences of each OS.
